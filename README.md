League of Legends jungle timers (AutoHotKey)

## Quick Start

* Download and install [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)
* Download [jingle_jangle.ahk](https://raw.github.com/IronSavior/jingle_jangle/master/jingle_jangle.ahk) and save anywhere you like.
* Double-click jingle_jangle.ahk

## Custom Alert Sound

You can place a file named `jj-alarm.mp3` in the same directory with `jingle_jangle.ahk` (restart the script if it is already running).  If this file exists when the script starts, then that sound will be used.  A system-default beep will be used when this file is not found.  You can edit the `Config` section in the script to change the file name if you like.
